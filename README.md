# GlslTester

GlslTester is a Python multi-platform application project based on the [__Kivy__ Framework](https://kivy.org) and
the [__ae__ (Application Environment)](https://ae.readthedocs.io "ae on rtd") namespace portions
 for to code and test shaders written in GLSL.

The included shaders from the GLSL Sandbox got adapted with an `alpha` parameter and some of them with a `tint_ink`
parameter.
