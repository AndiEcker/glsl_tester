# GlslTester

GlslTester is a Python multi-platform application project based on the [__Kivy__ Framework](https://kivy.org) and
the [__ae__ (Application Environment)](https://ae.readthedocs.io "ae on rtd") namespace portions to code and test
shaders written in GLSL.

Click on the ... button to select a shader file from the bundled shader examples and touch the + button to run it.
By clicking on the elliptic button appearing at the top the shader will be removed/stopped. Set the alpha to a value
below 1.0 if you want to add and mix the output of multiple shaders.

The bundled shaders from the GLSL Sandbox got adapted with uniform/input parameters. Use the mouse position, the last
touch position and/or the colors and sliders in the user preferences menu (like vibration/sound volume) to
dynamically change the input arguments of the running shader(s).
